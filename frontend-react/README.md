# Development Challenge for React

This challenge aims to evaluate basic skills in React development. The idea is to build an simple data query website for music bands.

## Functionality

The website has to contain the following pages/features:
* Login/authentication page. The rest of the pages have to be behind this "authorization wall".
* List and navigate bands
  Filter and sorting should be enabled.
* View information of a specific band, including albums.
* Logout


### Model & API

This is the API URL (using [My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/)):<br/>
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/improvein/dev-challenge

You can check the documentation for "JSON Server" to see how to interact with the API via filters, pagination, etc:<br/>

## Presentation

The result of this challenge should be presented as a GitHub or GitLab public repository.<br/>
Please add some minimal documentation (in the form of a README file) describing how to build and/or run the project and if there is any requirement or consideration to do so.

Oh, and please don't fork this repo in order to create your own. That way other people trying to complete this challenge won't be able to see solutions to it 😆.

Let's code 💻!
