# Development Challenge for Node.js

This challenge aims to evaluate basic skills in Node.js development, and a bit of data/entity modeling. The idea is to build an HTTP REST API.

## Functionality

The API has to fulfill the following conditions:

* Endpoints for authentication using JWT.<br/>
  Include an endpoint for refreshing the JWT access token.
* Endpoint for retrieving movies.<br/>
  It should be allowed to filter and sort by some field.
* Endpoint for retrieving the information (director included) of a specific episode of a TV Show.
* Endpoint for adding a new object (it could be for any entity you like).

### Model

Entities to consider:

* Movie<br/>
  Has many actors, but one director.
* TV Show<br/>
  Has many actors. It also has seasons and episodes inside each one.
* Actor<br/>
  Can be in different movies and TV shows.
* Director<br/>
  Can direct many movies and specific episodes of TV shows.

Use your common sense (or imagination ðŸ˜‰) to define the descriptive attributes/properties of each entity (e.g., name or genre).

## Tech Requirements

These are the following conditions for the development:

* The code should be using Node.js 16 or superior.
* The code could be written in JavaScript or TypeScript.
* All the code and comments should be written in English.
* Use a proper naming conventions and standards when defining the structure of the project and the name of variables, functions, etc.
* Use a proper structure to define the different path for the API endpoints.
* The use of ESLint or other linter is optional.
* The database could be relational or NoSQL, it's up to you. The use of ORM is optional too.
* The database doesn't need to be presented. But the model should be represented in some way. It could be in the form of ORM configuration or at least a minimal documentation or example of some of the entities.

## Presentation

The result of this challenge should be presented as a GitHub or GitLab **private** repository, giving access to the person that contacted you.

Please add some minimal documentation (in the form of a README file) describing how to run the project and if there is any requirement or consideration to do so.

**You can add or improve the project as much as you like, and these additional considerations will be taken into account:**

1. **API Documentation**: Including an OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) or similar documentation for the API is highly encouraged. This will help other developers understand how to use the endpoints and what data is expected.

2. **Testing Requirements**: Clarify if you added any level of testing to the project. If so, please include instructions on how to run the tests.

5. **Database Schema or Configuration**: While we mention that the database doesn't need to be presented, providing an example of the database schema or configuration would be very helpful. It could be a minimal SQL schema or an example for a NoSQL database.

6. **Error Handling**: Clarify how errors should be handled in the API. This is particularly important for the authentication and database operations.

7. **Validation and Data Transformation**: Clearly state how input data should be validated and transformed before being stored in the database or returned in responses.

8. **Sample Requests and Responses**: Providing sample requests and responses for each endpoint in the documentation would make it easier for developers to understand the expected behavior.

11. **Deployment and Hosting**: You are not required to deploy the project, but if you do, please mention it in the README file.

12. **Additional Features**: If there are any additional features you'd like to showcase, please mention them in the README file.

15. **Include Data Seeding**: For testing and development purposes, including a data seeding script or instructions is appreciated.

16. **Containerization**: If you'd like to showcase your containerization skills, please include a Dockerfile or instructions for building a Docker image.

Oh, and please don't link or fork this repo to create your own. That way other people trying to complete this challenge won't be able to see solutions to it ðŸ˜†.

Let's code ðŸ’»!
